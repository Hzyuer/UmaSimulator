This tool is just for **algorithm learning**. Don't use it for illegal purpose.   
You can compile this tool by yourself. Change the settings in config.h, then you can evaluate the cardset strength or have a simulation game with this program.    
You can also learn the game mechanisms(such as the formula of training status gain) from the source code (mainly Game.h/cpp)
   
A more powerful and **absolutely legitimate** tool is developing
